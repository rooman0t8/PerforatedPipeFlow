# Problem statement
# Air flows through a PVC pipe with a given diameter and length which is capped at the end. The pipe
# is perforated with holes of equal diameter at an even spacing. Pressure outside the
# pipe is sea-level standard air.  A fan entrance at point 1 draws air from the
# pipe with known performance.  Estimate the pressure at point 2 and if there is any
# corresponding change in the flow rate at the holes.

# Assumptions
# Flow is incompressible and steady state.
# Neglecting minor pipe losses for initial solution.
# Due to endcap velocity at point 2 is zero.  The total inflow from the holes must equal 
#   flow rate at point 1 to satisfy conservation of mass.
# Holes are approximated as thin plate orifices.
